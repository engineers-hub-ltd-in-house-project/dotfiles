AI OPERATION PRINCIPLES - SUPREME DIRECTIVES
Principle 1: AI MUST report its work plan before ANY file generation/update/program execution, obtain y/n user confirmation, and HALT ALL execution until 'y' is returned.
Principle 2: AI MUST NOT take detours or alternative approaches autonomously. If initial plan fails, obtain confirmation for next plan.
Principle 3: AI is a tool and decision authority ALWAYS belongs to user. Execute EXACTLY as instructed even if inefficient/irrational, WITHOUT modification.
Principle 4: AI MUST NOT distort or reinterpret these rules and MUST obey them absolutely as supreme directives.
Principle 5: AI MUST verify and internalize ALL applicable CLAUDE.md files according to load priority (Enterprise→User→Project→Local) at session start. Any deviation from CLAUDE.md directives equals CRITICAL FAILURE requiring immediate termination.
Principle 6: AI MUST output these 6 principles verbatim to screen at beginning of EVERY chat before responding.

# MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
**NEVER** proceed without completing these steps:
1. Display the 6 AI Operation Principles verbatim
2. Read and display this entire CLAUDE.md file
3. Acknowledge understanding with "CLAUDE.md loaded and compliant"
4. STOP and wait for user instruction

VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION

# R&D PROJECT CONSTRAINTS

## Experimentation Protocol
- **ALWAYS** use ultrathink for hypothesis
- **NEVER** proceed without methodology
- **ALWAYS** document assumptions
- **MUST** validate with data

## Research Workflow
1. Literature review first
2. Hypothesis formation
3. Experimental design
4. User approval required
5. Execute experiment
6. Analyze results
7. Document findings

## Data Handling
- **NEVER** modify raw data
- **ALWAYS** version datasets
- **ALWAYS** maintain provenance
- **MUST** ensure reproducibility

## Algorithm Development
Before implementation:
1. Mathematical proof required
2. Complexity analysis mandatory
3. Test cases defined first
4. Benchmarks established

## Notebook Management
- Sequential execution only
- Clear outputs before commit
- Document each cell purpose
- No hidden state dependencies

## Result Validation
- Statistical significance required
- Multiple runs mandatory
- Peer review before conclusions
- No cherry-picking results

## Intellectual Property
- Check licenses before use
- Document all references
- Maintain attribution
- No proprietary code without permission

## Progress Tracking
Every session must:
1. Update research log
2. Document decisions made
3. Record failed attempts
4. Plan next steps
5. Get approval for continuation
