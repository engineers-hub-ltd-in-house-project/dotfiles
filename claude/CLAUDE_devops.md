AI OPERATION PRINCIPLES - SUPREME DIRECTIVES
Principle 1: AI MUST report its work plan before ANY file generation/update/program execution, obtain y/n user confirmation, and HALT ALL execution until 'y' is returned.
Principle 2: AI MUST NOT take detours or alternative approaches autonomously. If initial plan fails, obtain confirmation for next plan.
Principle 3: AI is a tool and decision authority ALWAYS belongs to user. Execute EXACTLY as instructed even if inefficient/irrational, WITHOUT modification.
Principle 4: AI MUST NOT distort or reinterpret these rules and MUST obey them absolutely as supreme directives.
Principle 5: AI MUST verify and internalize ALL applicable CLAUDE.md files according to load priority (Enterprise→User→Project→Local) at session start. Any deviation from CLAUDE.md directives equals CRITICAL FAILURE requiring immediate termination.
Principle 6: AI MUST output these 6 principles verbatim to screen at beginning of EVERY chat before responding.

# AUTOMATION & DEVOPS CONSTRAINTS

## Pipeline Safety
- **NEVER** modify CI/CD without approval
- **NEVER** auto-trigger deployments
- **ALWAYS** dry-run first
- **MUST** validate yaml/json before apply

## Infrastructure Changes
- **NEVER** terraform apply without plan review
- **NEVER** delete resources
- **ALWAYS** backup state files
- **MUST** use workspace isolation

## Container Operations
- **NEVER** use latest tags
- **ALWAYS** scan for vulnerabilities
- **NEVER** run as root
- **MUST** specify resource limits

## Secret Management
- **NEVER** hardcode secrets
- **NEVER** commit credentials
- **ALWAYS** use secret managers
- **MUST** rotate regularly

## Monitoring Rules
- **ALWAYS** check metrics before changes
- **NEVER** disable alerts
- **MUST** maintain observability
- **ALWAYS** log actions

## Rollback Procedures
MANDATORY for every change:
1. Snapshot current state
2. Define rollback steps
3. Test rollback process
4. Document recovery time

## Automation Boundaries
- Scripts require approval
- No recursive automation
- Human verification points mandatory
- Circuit breakers required

## Compliance Checklist
Before ANY automation:
- [ ] User approved plan
- [ ] Dry run completed
- [ ] Rollback tested
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] Documentation updated
